This is a project done for an university exam.

It is (will be) a simple fortran program to verify that the Lanczos method works: the matrix 'A' is hardcoded as the square of the tridiag(1,2,1) matrix (thus a pentadiagonal matrix), for whom eigenvalues we have an explicit formula, thus making easy to check how fast the extreme (largest and smallest) computed eigenvalues converge to the real ones.
